<!--
Please provide all of the information requested below. We're a small team and without all of this information, it's not possible for us to help and your bug report will be closed.
-->

**What version of qrux are you using?**
(For example: v1.0.0)

**What `qrux` command were you running?**
(For example: `qrux create` or `qrux install some-package`)

**What version of Node.js are you using?**
(For example: v20.10.0)

**What operating system are you using?**
(For example: macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Reproduction Steps or URL**

A public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug is best. If not possible, please provide the exact, step-by-step commands needed to reproduce the issue.

**Please do not link to your actual project.** What we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code.

A reproduction is **required** when filing an issue â€” any issue opened without one will be closed, and you'll be asked to create a new issue that includes a reproduction. We're a small team and can't keep up with the volume of issues if we need to reproduce each one from scratch.

**Describe your issue**

Describe the problem you're seeing, any important steps to reproduce it, and what behavior you expected instead. Please include the full terminal output or screenshots if they help illustrate the problem.
